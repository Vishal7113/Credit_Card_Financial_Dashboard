# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Step 1:Import data to SQL database
1. Prepare csv file
2. Create tables in SQL
3. import csv file into SQL
Step 2:Connect with Mysql database in Power Bi
Step 3:3 & 4 column Added in Table in power Bi with DAX Queries
1. Revenue = 'ccdb cc_detail'[Annual_Fees] + 'ccdb cc_detail'[Total_Trans_Amt] + 'ccdb cc_detail'[Interest_Earned]
2. Week_num2 = WEEKNUM('ccdb cc_detail'[Week_Start_Date])
3. AgeGroup = SWITCH(TRUE(),'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age] < 30,"20-30",'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age] >= 30 && 'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age] < 40,"30-40",'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age] >= 40 && 'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age] < 50,"40-50",'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age] >= 50 && 'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age] < 60,"50-60",'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age] >= 60, "60+","unknown")
4. IncomeGroup = SWITCH(TRUE(),'ccdb cust_detail'[Income] < 35000, "Low",'ccdb cust_detail'[Income] >= 35000 && 'ccdb cust_detail'[Income] <70000, "Med",'ccdb cust_detail'[Income] >= 70000, "High","unknown")
Step 4: Some Measure created with Dax Queries
1. Previous_Week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('ccdb cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('ccdb cc_detail'),
        'ccdb cc_detail'[Week_num2] = MAX('ccdb cc_detail'[Week_num2])-1))
2. Current_Week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('ccdb cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('ccdb cc_detail'),
        'ccdb cc_detail'[Week_num2] = MAX('ccdb cc_detail'[Week_num2])))
3.    wow_revenue = DIVIDE([Current_Week_Revenue] - [Previous_Week_Revenue],[Previous_Week_Revenue])
Step 5: Then I'm Created Dashboard
